# CodeSlices üöÄ

Welcome to CodeSlices, a website dedicated to helping developers improve their coding skills through design slicing. Here you'll find a collection of free Figma designs that you can download and slice into code. 

The website was created by Alif Januantara, a student of Sistem Informasi as a task for web design subject, as a way to help other developers learn and improve their skills. So why not give it a try and see what you can slice?
